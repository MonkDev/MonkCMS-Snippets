# class Meta

Provides methods to get standardized content for meta tags.

### To-do

- The class structure overall could be improved.
- Some content is output as HTML and some is plain text, and it's not clear what we should expect. Let's include a helper method to convert HTML to plain text, just in case.
- We will need to use something like this to better output content for open graph and meta tags.
