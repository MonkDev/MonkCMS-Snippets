# Update media links | jQuery

## Runs through links on a page to update to current media file location.

## Advantage is media.monkserve.com links are also replaced, but only on page load. Use as a temporary solution.

1) Copy the "_temp" directory to your site root.

2) Include the javascript file in your site.
