# MonkCMS Snippets

Check here for snippets for building websites with the MonkCMS/ Ekklesia 360 content management systems.

MonkCMS is a CMS designed from the ground up by [Monk Development, Inc](http://www.monkdevelopment.com/). Content goes in via the MonkCMS web application and goes out via getContent() API calls embedded within site templates.

Instead of having to build a website around a CMS, developers look to MonkCMS for simple content integration, staying true to their design goals from start to finish.

For complete API documentation, see [http://developers.monkcms.com/](http://developers.monkcms.com/).
